## What is this? üßê

A minimal wrapper around [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox) to quickly add a [service worker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Service_Worker_API) via your webpack build process.

## Installation & Usage üì¶

1. Add this package to your project:

   `yarn add service-worker-webpack`

2. Update your `webpack.config.js`:

   ```js
   const ServiceWorkerPlugin = require("service-worker-webpack-plugin");

   module.exports = {
     plugins: [new ServiceWorkerPlugin()],
   };
   ```

| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| enableInDevelopment | Enable the service worker in local development.<br><br>Depending on your service worker configuration, this can be problematic for developer<br>workflows where you end up serving outdated cached files.<br><br>If `false` then a placeholder service worker will be generated, which will immediately clear<br>any previously installed service workers that may have been installed previously such as testing<br>a production build locally.<br><br>Defaults to `false`. Recommended: `false` for general development, `true` for first time setup and<br>when debugging your application's service worker. | boolean |

## Examples üöÄ

Check out the [service-worker-webpack-example](https://github.com/tatethurston/service-worker-webpack/blob/master/examples/react-example/).

## Warning ‚ö†Ô∏è

You must serve your application over HTTPS in production environments. [Service Workers must be served from the site's origin over HTTPS](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/primers/service-workers). A special case is made for `localhost`, so this is generally not necessary during local development. HTTPS is _not_ handled by this library.

The origin constraint means that the service worker can not control `mysite.com` if it was served from something like `mycdn.mysite.com`.
